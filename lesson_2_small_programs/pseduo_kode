----- Pseudo Code Key 
START start of the program
SET sets a variable we can use for later
GET retrieve input from user
PRINT displays output to user
READ  retrieve value from variable
IF / ELSE IF / ELSE show conditional branches in logic
WHILE show looping logic
END end of the program


1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
  PRINT a prompt to get first input from user
    GET the first input from the user 
    SET the input from the user to a local variable 
  PRINT a prompt to get the second input from the user 
    GET the second input from the user 
    SET the input from the user to a local variable 
  ADD the first local variable with the second local variable
  SET the sum to a local variable
  RETURN the local variable with the sum from the method

2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
  PRINT a prompt for a user to type in a single word with no symbols
    SET the input to a local variable 
    SPLIT the local variable with an empty space 
    SET the return value of the SPLIT into a new local variable 
    SET an empty string local variable
    SET a iterator variable to 0
    SET the result of calling LENGTH on the SPLIT local variable to a new local variable
      USE the LENGTH local variable to START a loop 
        ADD the first character into the empty local variable 
        COUNT up 1 
        ADD the second character into local variable with the new character
        etc. 
      END loop 
      PRINT the local variable out to the screen

3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element
   SET a iterator local variable starting at 0 named COUNT 
   SET up a new local variable to an empty array named OFFSET
    START a loop using the length of the original array of integers 
     IF COUNT modulo 2 has a remainder  
       use COUNT to enter the array of integers and SET element to empty string APPEND into OFFSET
      COUNT up 1 NEXT
     ENDIF
       use COUNT to enter the array of integers and APPEND integer into OFFSET
      COUNT up 1 
       etc. 
    END loop 
    PRINT OFFSET to screen
